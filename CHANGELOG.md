# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The scroll owner now handles DOM environments without `document.scrollingElement`; when a previously scrollable thread loses its scroll container, the stale listener is cleaned up safely instead of crashing. A browser regression fixture covers the transition after a prior owner was selected.
- `ChatApp` (`@bitbaum/chatkit/react`): the whole chat app — header, chat list (drawer on a phone, rail when wide), New chat, Temporary chat, titles, rename and delete, the open chat restored on reload, turns that keep running in the background, the queue, attachments on by default. Additive: `ChatScreen`, `Composer` and `ChatThread` are unchanged.
- `ConversationStore` with `localConversationStore` (device, versioned, never throws) and `httpConversationStore` (REST); `deriveTitle`, `groupConversations`, `filterConversations`, `formatConversationDate`, `pickRestored`, `copyConversations`.
- `ChatMessageData.attachments` draws what the person sent above their bubble; `Composer stagedPosition="above"` stages pictures above the text.
- `docs/fleet-chat-matrix.md`: every product's chat, side by side.

- Embedded conversations now let scroll gestures reach the actual page or ancestor scroller. Reading an older answer stays stable through status updates, arriving assistant turns and resizing; a new user message or the return-to-latest action resumes following. The same behavior is covered in page, panel and nested browser fixtures.
- Release verification installs the browser required by the package's own checks.
